# CHB-MIT Seizure Prediction - Data preparation ðŸ§  ðŸ“Š

## Description

This repository contains the code for preparing the CHB-MIT Seizure Prediction dataset for a comparative study of different modern Deep Learning techniques to predict the pre-ictal period using EEG data. The study is part of the final project for the Biomedical Engineering degree by MatÃ­as N. Sosa and Cristian E. Morilla.

The code in this repository transforms the raw data into a format that can be used for training and testing various Deep Learning models for seizure prediction.

Data preparation includes analysis, feature extraction, feature selection and transformation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages (see requirements.txt)
3. Edit the data_path.txt file with the local data folder path on your system. You have to download

## Create `data_path.txt` file

To avoid conflicts and ensure that each team member has access to their own data safely, each member can have their own data_path.txt file in their local project folder, which specifies the path to the data folder on their system. The data_path.txt file is added to the .gitignore file, so each team member's file is not uploaded to the repository.

To read the data folder path from the data_path.txt file, each team member edits their own data_path.txt file with the local data folder path on their system. Then, when running the Python code, it reads the data folder path from the local data_path.txt file. This approach allows each team member to specify their own data folder path without affecting the project's code, but it may be a bit more complicated to set up compared to using environment variables.
